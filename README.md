# BlackBoard (project in French)
BlackBoard is a prototype of what one can come up with when creating a back-office website.

The idea with this project is to replicate a typical e-commerce database, designing a back-office interface that will allow admins to deal with stocks, messages from customers, pending tasks... All based on a NoSQL database.

**Neat feature:**

- Real-time interactive graphs about clients gender distribution, messages, shipped orders, and monthly turnover, all plugged into the database (via Chart.JS API)
